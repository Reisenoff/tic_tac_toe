# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players.
____
## Description

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses. The game allows two human players to take turns and make their moves until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each cell is represented by its coordinates (row and column), starting from 0.
Players take turns making their moves by entering the coordinates of the cell they want to mark (e.g., "1 1" for the center cell).
The game continues until one of the players wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Getting Started

## How to Run
